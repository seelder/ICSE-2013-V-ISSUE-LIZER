This repository contains information related to the tool V:ISSUE:LIZER presented at International Conference on Software Engineering, 2013. The tool was originally presented in [this paper](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2486997)

This repository _is not_ the original repository for this tool. Here are some links to the original project:
* [The Official Project Page](http://thesegalgroup.org/58/vissuelizer-prototype-for-analyzing-distributed-requirements-clarification/)
* [A Video of the Tool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy3xvzjy3BQ)

In this repository, for ReAssert you will find:
:white_check_mark: [Source code (available)](https://github.com/oerich/ReqtDisc)
* :x: Original tool (not available)

This tool was certified as UnWorkable for this project because when I tried building the tool from the source code, it hit various dependency issues which could not be resolved. Also neither the executable nor the dataset required for it was available on the Internet. 
This repository was constructed by [Gargi Rajadhyaksha](https://github.com/gsrajadh/) under the supervision of [Emerson Murphy-Hill](https://github.com/CaptainEmerson).
